#### Lecture project

Folder `reference-project` contains sources of the project developed by 
Claus Gittinger as part of the lectures. They are as-is, no comments or 
anything, so I advise you to visit the lectures.

To get better bearings of the project development, try checkouting
different commits - usually one commit corresponds to one lecture or
one block of work. See [commits list](https://github.com/melkamar/mi-run/commits/master).
